# Car Price Prediction

### Introduction
The objective of this project to make a end to end machine learning project and help others in figuring out their old car's selling price.

Hence,for instance, we get data from the car website CarDekho.com, filled with information on a wide variety of cars, including their selling price and present price. We realize that we can use this data to make sure we get a good deal on a new car. In particular, we can figure out exactly how much one should pay for a specific type of car.

### About the dataset
This dataset contains information about used cars listed on www.cardekho.com This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning. The columns in the given dataset is as follows:

Car_Name  
Year  
Selling_Price  
Present_Price  
Kms_Driven  
Fuel_Type  
Seller_Type  
Transmission  
Owner  

#### I have used the RandomForestRegressor to solve this ML problem.
